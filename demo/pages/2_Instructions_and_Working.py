    """The project's primary objective is to create a robust algorithm capable of real-time video enhancement to improve visibility in areas affected by smoke and haze due to indoor fires. By leveraging artificial intelligence and machine learning, FireScope will restore video feeds from fire-stricken environments, allowing first responders and rescue teams to navigate hazardous situations with increased clarity and precision.""")

    """FireScope's algorithm will be designed to work seamlessly with existing surveillance camera systems, drones, and other video capture devices commonly used in fire emergency scenarios. The algorithm will intelligently identify and remove smoke and haze from live video streams, enabling rescue teams to:""")

st.markdown("""1. **Enhance situational awareness:** By providing clear and unobstructed views of the affected area, FireScope will help first responders better assess the situation, locate potential victims, and plan their rescue strategies.

2. **Improve safety:** With improved visibility, rescue teams can navigate through smoke-filled spaces with reduced risk, ensuring their own safety while conducting life-saving operations.

3. **Optimize resources:** FireScope's real-time capabilities will enable rescue teams to allocate resources efficiently, focusing on areas where they are needed most, and potentially reducing response times.

4. **Enhance decision-making:** Clear video feeds will empower incident commanders to make informed decisions quickly and adapt their strategies based on real-time information.""")
